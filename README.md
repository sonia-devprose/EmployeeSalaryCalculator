# EmployeeSalaryCalculator

This C# program calculates and displays an employee's ID, weekly hours worked, hourly wage, monthly bonus, and annual salary using various data types (short, int, float, double).

Different data types are used to optimize memory and precision:

- **`short`** for Employee ID: Small integers, using 2 bytes.
- **`int`** for Hours Worked: Whole numbers, using 4 bytes.
- **`float`** for Hourly Wage and Monthly Bonus: Decimal values with less precision, using 4 bytes.
- **`double`** for Annual Salary: High precision for financial calculations, using 8 bytes.
